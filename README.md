## Mongo DB simple terminal client

This was a project part of our module 165. It was to create a terminal client that is meant to used by people, who can't programm so it had to be simple.


#### Pymongo

The package Pymongo is the package that I used. It's simple and easy to use. The project is implemented in Python.
To use the project:

Install python and mongodb:

Windows:
````bash
winget install python 
winget install mongodb
````
Linux/Ubuntu:
````bash
sudo apt install python
sudo apt install mongodb
````
MacOS:
````bash
brew install python
brew install mongodb
````

And then clone this repo:
````bash
git clone https://github.com/AmanuelIsaak/M165
````

Set up the MongoDB credentials and create a database. There is an example of a database for Video Games.
But feel free to create your own database.
